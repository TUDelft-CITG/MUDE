# Exercises

A number of exercises are included in this chapter that illustrate the previously discussed concepts of risk and reliability in a probabilistic design context. At the end a set of **sample exam** questions are included.

The 'real' exam will be similar to the sample exam questions (but not as many!). Some of the other exercise questions in this chapter illustrate interesting concepts, but are outside the scope of the exam; notes are added to point this out. Finally, the 'real' exam questions will be based on applications other than flood risk.
