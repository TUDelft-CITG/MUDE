# Two Random Variables

Two rivers upstream.

sum of the two

how to find the probability?

%design point consideration NOT included here!!!

## old stuff

This becomes much more interesting, but already a lot more complex.

Start with two loads. Illustrated using
- intuition
- Venn diagrams
- bivariate plot

Key concept: component reliability is nothing more than an integration over a specific region of a multivariate probability density function. Often this region describes failure of a component, which we will try to keep below an acceptable level.

Then introduce (illustration only):
- joint / and (discrete)
- union / or (discrete)
- Brief illustration: $Z = R - S$

Given a specific scenario, you should understand the difficulty associated with choosing specific design values when more than one random variable is considered, and be able to represent the failure probability analytically and graphically. For simple measures of dependence (correlation coefficient, $\rho$) you can describe the quantitative influence on failure probability. You should also recognize how a function of random variables can be used the univariate case is simple, it can also be extended to a function of random variables, which implicitly assumes a more complex multivariate probability distribution though the marginal distributions of the (random) input variables. This topic is covered more thoroughly in the **Component Reliability** chapter.
