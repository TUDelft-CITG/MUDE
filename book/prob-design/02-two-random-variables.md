# Two Random Variables

This becomes much more interesting, but already a lot more complex.

Start with two loads. Illustrated using
- intuition
- Venn diagrams
- bivariate plot

Key concept: component reliability is nothing more than an integration over a specific region of a multivariate probability density function. Often this region describes failure of a component, which we will try to keep below an acceptable level.

Then introduce (illustration only):
- joint / and (discrete)
- union / or (discrete)
- Brief illustration: $Z = R - S$

Given a specific scenario, you should understand the difficulty associated with choosing specific design values, and be able to represent the failure probability analytically and graphically. For simple measures of dependence (correlation coefficient, $\rho$) you can describe the quantitative influence on failure probability. This topic is covered more thoroughly in the **Component Reliability** chapter.
