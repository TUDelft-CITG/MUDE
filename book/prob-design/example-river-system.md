# Flood Management Case Study

As mentioned on Introduction page:
> Throughout this book we will repeatedly draw on the field of flood management to illustrate risk and reliability concepts as this field requires expertise from all perspectives in civil and environmental engineering and geosciences, from climate and hydrologic processes to evacuation and recovery. 

After introducing key elements of the system, topics may include:
- hazard
- levee failure, conditional on the hazard
- consequences
- integration (sum) to get risk
- assume we can establish a max value, then we can derive the required safety level for our levee
- fragility curve

You are not required to memorize all aspects of this example, but should be capable of describing how simple risk and reliability concepts can be used for a specific analysis, as well as carrying it out. For example, recognizing that the probability of exceeding a certain water level per year can be modeled with a probability distribution, which is then used to select a design crest level for a levee along the river for a given probability of exceedance.
