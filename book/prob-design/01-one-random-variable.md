# One Random Variable

Let's consider that the load is random.

Discrete.

Continuous.

Illustration of exceedance probability approach. Compare 1/10,000 with:  
$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(\text{levee failure}|h)\cdot f(h) \text{d}h$

Given a probability requirement and distribution for a random variable of interest, you should be able to find the appropriate design value. You should also recognize the influence that the *choice* of distribution or probability requirement may have on the final design, especially in terms of model validity and financial cost. Although the univariate case is simple, it can also be extended to a function of random variables, which is implicitly assumes a more complex multivariate probability distribution. This topic is covered more thoroughly in the **Component Reliability** chapter.
