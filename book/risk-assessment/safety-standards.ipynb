    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Two aspects are typically considered when evaluating and regulating risks to the public: the total or population-wide effects, and the distribution of effects within the affected population. {numref}`risk_evaluation` summarizes these perspectives. The societal perspective is concerned with ‘total effect’ and the effects of large-scale accidents on the society, in terms of economic damages and life loss. The individual perspective is concerned with distributive justice (‘equity’), i.e. the distribution of harm over the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "As risk is often the by-product of an otherwise legitimate and advantageous activity, such as production or transportation, regulating risks is essentially a balancing act between economic and social activities on the hand and a sufficiently safe society on the other hand ⚠️(e.g. Jongejan, 2008): just as too lenient regulations are suboptimal, too stringent ones are too.\n",

    "Based on this general concept, it has been proposed to evaluate risks based on three criteria ⚠️(TAW, 1985; Vrijling et al, 1995; 1998):\n",
    "- To limit the **invidual risk** to prevent that certain people are exposed to disproportionally large risks;\n",
    "- To limit the **societal risk** to limit the risks of large scale accidents with many fatalities;\n",
    "- **Economic optimization** to balance investments in risk reduction from an economic point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **individual risk** concerns the probability of death of a person due to an accident. Various related definitions exist. The “average individual risk” for a certain activity can be calculated, e.g. the individual risk due to smoking or the risk of an airplane crash for a frequent flyer. {numref}`death_probability` compares the probability of lethal accidents for various types of accidents.\n",

This is applied in the industrial safety policy in the Netherlands (see next section).\n",

If only 1000 cars are sold in the Netherlands, the number of fatal accidents with this car is rare, i.e. 0.01 fatalities per year. However, when the car becomes popular and 10 million cars are sold, the average number of fatalities due to technical failure becomes 100 per year. This may well lead to public concerns and indignation. From a societal point of view this may no longer be acceptable, whereas the individual risk has not changed.\n",

To put the stringency of the individual risk criteria into perspective, one could consider the effect of the probability of an accident on life expectancy.

After a number of severe industrial accidents, including the Bhopal accident in 1984 which killed an estimated 3000 people and severely injured over 200.000, a European directive was drafted concerning the prevention of major accidents: the 1982 Seveso Directive. This was later replaced by the Seveso II Directive.\n",

Individual risk is therefore also named local risk (“plaatsgebonden risico”) in the Netherlands. The shape of the risk contours for other applications will look different.

As a third criterion the economic optimization can be added. The optimal or acceptable probability of failure depends on the damage and investment costs. A relationship with the graph below can be established by assuming that the number of fatalities is related to the economic damages. A dike ring with many inhabitants and potential fatalities will generally also represent a large economic value. For the sake of the example we assume that every fatality corresponds to an economic damage of €$5 \\cdot 10^7$ (note: this is not equal to the value of a human life). To calculate the economic optimum for the example we assume arbitrary values of $r=0.025$ and  €$5 \\cdot 10^6$ $B=0.33$. {numref}`combined_risk_criteria` below shows the combination for the three criteria. \n",

In the year 2014 new safety standards have been proposed for primary flood defences in the Netherlands. These have been derived based on a risk assessment, and standards have been formulated as a (tolerable) probability of failure of the flood defences. More information on this field of application will be given during the lectures. "

    "[^neutral]: It should be noted that the usage of the term “risk neutral” to describe the FN-curve limit line for $\\alpha = 1$ is widespread but, strictly speaking, incorrect in the context of decision theory (see ⚠️section 3.3). This is because the cost of risk bearing to a risk neutral decision maker equals expected loss (i.e. the product of probabilities and damages). The FN-curve shows cumulative probabilities, however. Also, an individual crossing of the limit line would not necessarily disturb a risk neutral decision maker, provided the other accident scenarios have relatively small probabilities.  \n",
