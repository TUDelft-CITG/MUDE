# Risk Analysis

This chapter introduces the concept of risk and steps of a risk analysis. The following two chapters introduce quantitative analysis (step 3) and the final chapter covers risk assessment.

Pages will be:
- Risk: 
  - definition quantification (integral)
  - steps in a risk analysis (maybe also in probabilistic design part?)
  - units, illustrated with...
  - examples of risk (metrics)
- Types of risk used in MUDE / flood risk example


```{warning}
Point out how a single risk value can used as a design criteria, which links to probability. Can also consider illustrating risk types.
```

```{warning}
Add integrals and (mathematical) statement of individual risk as combination of conditional probabilities.
```

It is noted that a (probabilistic) risk analysis is different  from a (deterministic) scenario analysis. A risk analysis is based on quantitative analysis of all (known) undesired events and their probabilities and consequences. A scenario analysis considers one (or a limited number) of design scenarios, often without considering its failure probability. Both approaches are complementary, as a scenario analysis considers one of the scenarios from the risk analysis. 

In the Netherlands, scenario analysis is often used for evaluating disaster preparedness and designing the capabilities of emergency management services. For example, in the design of the Green Heart Tunnel which is a part of the high speed rail line in the Netherlands, a single accident scenario was chosen to design the emergency exits out of the tunnel. Analysing a high impact, low probability scenario in detail may provide helpful clues about the effectiveness of particular safety measures or crisis management actions. While such analyses may be helpful, it would be wrong to assume that such high-impact, low probability scenarios should always be properly manageable by emergency responders. This is because the probability of harm should be an integral part of any cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis (Jongejan et al., 2011).



This book splits risk into two parts: risk *analysis* and risk *assessment.* This chapter considers the analysis of risks from a broad perspective, beginning with definitions and key steps of a risk analysis. The next two chapters explore the quantitative analyses (component and system reliability) before returning to risk concepts of decision theory, cost benefit analysis and safety standards.

The relationship between safety standards and engineering design is indicated in section 3.6.
