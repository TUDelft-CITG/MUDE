# Risk and Risk Analysis

This chapter introduces the concept of risk and steps of a risk analysis. The following two chapters introduce quantitative analysis (step 3) and the final chapter covers risk assessment.

Pages will be:
- Risk: 
  - definition quantification (integral)
  - steps in a risk analysis (maybe also in probabilistic design part?)
  - units, illustrated with...
  - examples of risk (metrics)
- Types of risk used in MUDE / flood risk example

This chapter already has a really cool example calculation!
