# Risk Analysis

This book splits risk into two parts: risk *analysis* and risk *assessment.* This chapter considers the analysis of risks from a broad perspective, beginning with definitions and key steps of a risk analysis, illustrated quantitatively through an FN curve. The next two chapters explore quantitative analyses (component and system reliability) before returning to risk assessment concepts of decision theory, cost benefit analysis and safety standards, where the principal focus is on making decisions and answering the question 'how safe is safe enough?'

Point out how a single risk value can used as a design criteria, which links to probability. Can also consider illustrating risk types.

On Definitions page, still need to add integrals and (mathematical) statement of individual risk as combination of conditional probabilities.

Consider adding a page to explain units and perhaps an overview of risk metrics, especially those used in flood risk exmaple (can add some examples to illustrate the steps?).

The relationship between safety standards and engineering design is indicated in section 3.6.

%It is noted that a (probabilistic) risk analysis is different  from a (deterministic) scenario analysis. A risk analysis is based on quantitative analysis of all (known) undesired events and their probabilities and consequences. A scenario analysis considers one (or a limited number) of design scenarios, often without considering its failure probability. Both approaches are complementary, as a scenario analysis considers one of the scenarios from the risk analysis. 

%In the Netherlands, scenario analysis is often used for evaluating disaster preparedness and designing the capabilities of emergency management services. For example, in the design of the Green Heart Tunnel which is a part of the high speed rail line in the Netherlands, a single accident scenario was chosen to design the emergency exits out of the tunnel. Analysing a high impact, low probability scenario in detail may provide helpful clues about the effectiveness of particular safety measures or crisis management actions. While such analyses may be helpful, it would be wrong to assume that such high-impact, low probability scenarios should always be properly manageable by emergency responders. This is because the probability of harm should be an integral part of any cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis (Jongejan et al., 2011).
