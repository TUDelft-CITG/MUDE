# Component Reliability

This is a key part of step 3 in a risk analysis: quantitative analysis.

Component reliability Analysis:  
- limit states (servicability, ultimate) and limit-state functions; failure definition
- Design frameworks 
- A simple case 
- Special page to illustrate partial safety factor approach. Start with univariate, then show bivariate (pointing out ‘choice’ that must be made for design point, reference it, then move along). 


- other
  - R-S
  - Z = R + S
  - non-linear
  - most of these should probably go in the component reliability chapter


Overview of non-linear problems (distribution and LSF); explanation of LSF; formulations of structural reliability. the area under the curve. Solution techniquest. Partial safety factor approach / LRFD / beta and reliability index.
