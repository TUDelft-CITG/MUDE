    "# Limits for individual and societal risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety standards can be used to set limits to the individual and societal risk. A **limit** value can be set for **individual risks**. Such a limit value is to avoid disproportionate exposures by laying down a minimum safety level for all individuals. In various fields of applications limit values in the range of 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ per year are used (see below for more information). To put the stringency of the individual risk criteria into perspective, one could consider the effect of the probability of an accident on life expectancy. When an average person would be constantly exposed to a maximum allowable level of risk of 10-6 per year, the decrease of his or her life expectancy would be only 1 day as shown in {numref}`individual-risk-life-expectancy`.\n",

    "Societal risk can be evaluated by means of an FN limit line. The calculated FN curve of the system should, in principle, not exceed the limit line. An FN-criterion is defined by three variables: (1) its base point (the exceedance probability of 1 fatality, i.e. C), (2) its slope ($\\alpha$), and (3) its probability and/or consequence cut-off ($A$ and $B$). ⚠️Figure 3.15 shows the different constraints that could make up an FN limit line. \n",

    "The general formulation for such a limit line without horizontal of vertical cut-off equals:\n",

    "- $C$ a constant that determines the vertical position of the limit line\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ a coefficient that determines the steepness of the limit line\n",
    "  \n",
    "The limit line is called risk neutral[^neutral] if $\\alpha=1$, since it places equal weight on exceedance probabilities and numbers of fatalities. If $\\alpha = 2$, the limit is risk averse. This means that that the exceedance probability of 10 times as many fatalities should be 100 times lower. This has been motivated by public aversion to large numbers of fatalities. For example, the loss of 1000 people in one accident (e.g. a major explosion) could be valued differently than  1000 losses of 1 person in separate accidents (e.g. in traffic).\n",
    "\n",
    "For different applications limit lines have been developed with varying constants and steepness. Examples of application areas include industrial risks in the Netherlands (next section), dams in the United States and Canada, and chemical risks in Hongkong and the UK ⚠️(Jonkman et al., 2003).\n",

    "```{admonition} Exaple: Risk matrix\n",
    "Risk matrices are often used in various industries for risk evaluation and decision support, for example for the evaluation of health and safety risks within a facility. For a given undesired event the extent of probability and consequences are estimated on a qualitative or semi-quantitative scale, see {numref}`risk_matrix` for an example. Ranges of failure probabilities or consequences can be assigned to the qualitative terms on the axes in the example. The combination of probability and consequence estimates determines whether the risk is acceptable or whether it requires more attention and risk reduction efforts. However, unlike the FN curve, the cumulative effects of multiple possible events are generally not considered in a risk matrix.\n",

    "[^neutral]: It should be noted that the usage of the term “risk neutral” to describe the FN-curve limit line for $\\alpha = 1$ is widespread but, strictly speaking, incorrect in the context of decision theory (see ⚠️section 3.3). This is because the cost of risk bearing to a risk neutral decision maker equals expected loss (i.e. the product of probabilities and damages). The FN-curve shows cumulative probabilities, however. Also, an individual crossing of the limit line would not necessarily disturb a risk neutral decision maker, provided the other accident scenarios have relatively small probabilities. "
