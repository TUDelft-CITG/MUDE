    "When answering the question “how safe is safe enough” a merely economic treatment with cost benefit analysis or economic optimization is often not sufficient for activities with risks to people. Therefore, criteria have been developed that focus on risks to human life. This section focuses on safety standards and criteria for evaluating the risk to life. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Two aspects are typically considered when evaluating and regulating risks to the public: the total or population-wide effects, and the distribution of effects within the affected population. {numref}`risk_evaluation` summarizes these perspectives. The societal perspective is concerned with ‘total effect’ and the effects of large-scale accidents on the society, in terms of economic damages and life loss. The individual perspective is concerned with distributive justice (‘equity’), i.e. the distribution of harm over the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "As risk is often the by-product of an otherwise legitimate and advantageous activity, such as production or transportation, regulating risks is essentially a balancing act between economic and social activities on the hand and a sufficiently safe society on the other hand ⚠️(e.g. Jongejan, 2008): just as too lenient regulations are suboptimal, too stringent ones are too.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this general concept, it has been proposed to evaluate risks based on three criteria ⚠️(TAW, 1985; Vrijling et al, 1995; 1998):\n",
    "- To limit the **invidual risk** to prevent that certain people are exposed to disproportionally large risks;\n",
    "- To limit the **societal risk** to limit the risks of large scale accidents with many fatalities;\n",
    "- **Economic optimization** to balance investments in risk reduction from an economic point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **individual risk** concerns the probability of death of a person due to an accident. Various related definitions exist. The “average individual risk” for a certain activity can be calculated, e.g. the individual risk due to smoking or the risk of an airplane crash for a frequent flyer. {numref}`death_probability` compares the probability of lethal accidents for various types of accidents.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both the individual risk and $P_{d|f}$ can be formulated as a function of a location near a risk source. If it is assumed that a person is permanently present at that location, the individual risk becomes a property of that location and it can be used for zoning and land use planning. This is applied in the industrial safety policy in the Netherlands (see next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Societal risk** refers to the probability of an accident with multiple fatalities. It is often graphically represented by an FN-curve that shows the exceedance probabilities of the potential numbers of fatalities ($P(N>n)$) on double log scale. A simplified example of the calculation of an FN curve is given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **economic optimization** has already been discussed in detail in ⚠️section 3.4.2. Possible criteria for acceptable individual and societal risk are discussed in the coming paragraphs. \n",

    "```{admonition} Example: Difference between individual and societal risk.\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between the individual and societal perspective, consider a fairly safe car that has a probability of 10$^{-5}$ per year of causing a fatality due to technical failure. This may well be acceptable to an individual. Such a probability is in the same range as the average death rate in traffic (650 fatalities / 17 million people which is about 4.10$^{-5}$ per year). If only 1000 cars are sold in the Netherlands, the number of fatal accidents with this car is rare, i.e. 0.01 fatalities per year. However, when the car becomes popular and 10 million cars are sold, the average number of fatalities due to technical failure becomes 100 per year. This may well lead to public concerns and indignation. From a societal point of view this may no longer be acceptable, whereas the individual risk has not changed.\n",

    "## Limits for individual and societal risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety standards can be used to set limits to the individual and societal risk. A **limit** value can be set for **individual risks**. Such a limit value is to avoid disproportionate exposures by laying down a minimum safety level for all individuals. In various fields of applications limit values in the range of 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ per year are used (see below for more information). To put the stringency of the individual risk criteria into perspective, one could consider the effect of the probability of an accident on life expectancy. When an average person would be constantly exposed to a maximum allowable level of risk of 10-6 per year, the decrease of his or her life expectancy would be only 1 day as shown in {numref}`individual-risk-life-expectancy`.\n",

    "Societal risk can be evaluated by means of an FN limit line. The calculated FN curve of the system should, in principle, not exceed the limit line. An FN-criterion is defined by three variables: (1) its base point (the exceedance probability of 1 fatality, i.e. C), (2) its slope ($\\alpha$), and (3) its probability and/or consequence cut-off ($A$ and $B$). ⚠️Figure 3.15 shows the different constraints that could make up an FN limit line. \n",

    "The limit line is called risk neutral[^neutral] if $\\alpha=1$, since it places equal weight on exceedance probabilities and numbers of fatalities. If $\\alpha = 2$, the limit is risk averse. This means that that the exceedance probability of 10 times as many fatalities should be 100 times lower. This has been motivated by public aversion to large numbers of fatalities. For example, the loss of 1000 people in one accident (e.g. a major explosion) could be valued differently than  1000 losses of 1 person in separate accidents (e.g. in traffic).\n",

    "For different applications limit lines have been developed with varying constants and steepness. Examples of application areas include industrial risks in the Netherlands (next section), dams in the United States and Canada, and chemical risks in Hongkong and the UK ⚠️(Jonkman et al., 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[^neutral]: It should be noted that the usage of the term “risk neutral” to describe the FN-curve limit line for $\\alpha = 1$ is widespread but, strictly speaking, incorrect in the context of decision theory (see ⚠️section 3.3). This is because the cost of risk bearing to a risk neutral decision maker equals expected loss (i.e. the product of probabilities and damages). The FN-curve shows cumulative probabilities, however. Also, an individual crossing of the limit line would not necessarily disturb a risk neutral decision maker, provided the other accident scenarios have relatively small probabilities. "

    "```{admonition} Exaple: Risk matrix\n",
    "Risk matrices are often used in various industries for risk evaluation and decision support, for example for the evaluation of health and safety risks within a facility. For a given undesired event the extent of probability and consequences are estimated on a qualitative or semi-quantitative scale, see {numref}`risk_matrix` for an example. Ranges of failure probabilities or consequences can be assigned to the qualitative terms on the axes in the example. The combination of probability and consequence estimates determines whether the risk is acceptable or whether it requires more attention and risk reduction efforts. However, unlike the FN curve, the cumulative effects of multiple possible events are generally not considered in a risk matrix.\n",
