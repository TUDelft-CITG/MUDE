    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Two aspects are typically considered when evaluating and regulating risks to the public: the total or population-wide effects, and the distribution of effects within the affected population. {numref}`risk_evaluation` summarizes these perspectives. The societal perspective is concerned with ‘total effect’ and the effects of large-scale accidents on the society, in terms of economic damages and life loss. The individual perspective is concerned with distributive justice (‘equity’), i.e. the distribution of harm over the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "As risk is often the by-product of an otherwise legitimate and advantageous activity, such as production or transportation, regulating risks is essentially a balancing act between economic and social activities on the hand and a sufficiently safe society on the other hand ⚠️(e.g. Jongejan, 2008): just as too lenient regulations are suboptimal, too stringent ones are too.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this general concept, it has been proposed to evaluate risks based on three criteria ⚠️(TAW, 1985; Vrijling et al, 1995; 1998):\n",
    "- To limit the **invidual risk** to prevent that certain people are exposed to disproportionally large risks;\n",
    "- To limit the **societal risk** to limit the risks of large scale accidents with many fatalities;\n",
    "- **Economic optimization** to balance investments in risk reduction from an economic point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **individual risk** concerns the probability of death of a person due to an accident. Various related definitions exist. The “average individual risk” for a certain activity can be calculated, e.g. the individual risk due to smoking or the risk of an airplane crash for a frequent flyer. {numref}`death_probability` compares the probability of lethal accidents for various types of accidents.\n",

    "The individual risk due to an accident can be calculated with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  IR = P_f P_{d|f}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $IR$ the individual risk [1/year]\n",
    "- $P_{f}$ the probability of an accident [1/year]\n",
    "- $P_{d|f}$ the conditional probability of death given an accident\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the individual risk and $P_{d|f}$ can be formulated as a function of a location near a risk source. If it is assumed that a person is permanently present at that location, the individual risk becomes a property of that location and it can be used for zoning and land use planning. This is applied in the industrial safety policy in the Netherlands (see next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Societal risk** refers to the probability of an accident with multiple fatalities. It is often graphically represented by an FN-curve that shows the exceedance probabilities of the potential numbers of fatalities ($P(N>n)$) on double log scale. A simplified example of the calculation of an FN curve is given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **economic optimization** has already been discussed in detail in ⚠️section 3.4.2. Possible criteria for acceptable individual and societal risk are discussed in the coming paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example: Difference between individual and societal risk.\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between the individual and societal perspective, consider a fairly safe car that has a probability of 10$^{-5}$ per year of causing a fatality due to technical failure. This may well be acceptable to an individual. Such a probability is in the same range as the average death rate in traffic (650 fatalities / 17 million people which is about 4.10$^{-5}$ per year). If only 1000 cars are sold in the Netherlands, the number of fatal accidents with this car is rare, i.e. 0.01 fatalities per year. However, when the car becomes popular and 10 million cars are sold, the average number of fatalities due to technical failure becomes 100 per year. This may well lead to public concerns and indignation. From a societal point of view this may no longer be acceptable, whereas the individual risk has not changed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example: calculation of an FN curve.\n",
    "The following example shows the composition of an FN curve for a system with two mutually exclusive event scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accident 1 with $N_1 = 10$ fatalities and a probability of $P_1 = 10^{-2}$ per year\n",
    "\n",
    "Accident 2 with $N_2 = 100$ fatalities and a probability of $P_2 = 10^{-3}$ per year\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this information the probability mass function can be formed (first graph). Consequently, the cumulative distribution function can be made (second graph). Finally, the probability of exceedance or the FN curve is made (third graph).\n",
    "Finally, we note that the expected value of the number of fatalities equals:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$\n",
    "  E(N) = P_1 N_1 + P_2 N_2 =  0.2\\text{ fatalities per year}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value will also be found when the surface of the area under the FN curve is computed ⚠️(Vrijling and van Gelder, 1997)."
